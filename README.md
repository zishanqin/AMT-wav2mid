## Abstract / Intro
There has been a multitude of recent research on using deep learning for music & audio generation and classification. In this paper, we plan to build on these works by implementing a novel system to automatically transcribe polyphonic music with an artificial neural network model. We show that by treating the transcription problem as an image classification problem we can use transformed audio data to predict the group of notes currently being played.

## Background

Entanglement is the current glass ceiling problem for framewise neural network music transcription. They present a few (really just one) possible solutions that I could try to implement (a loss function that takes entanglement into account).

## Design
The design for the system is as follows:
* Pre-process our data into an ingestible format, fourier-like transform of the audio and piano-roll conversion of midi files.
* Design a neural network model to estimate current notes from audio data
* Use frame-wise (simpler) or onsets (faster)
* Train on a large corpus of audio to midi
* Evaluate it's performance on audio/midi pairs we have not trained on

## Implementation
### Libraries
* Python - due to the abundance of music and machine learning libraries developed for it
* librosa - for digital signal processing methods
* pretty_midi - for midi manipulation methods
* TensorFlow - for neural networks
